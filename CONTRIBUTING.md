# Contributing to zerocaptcha

Thank you for helping. This repository is a small, working example that ZeroCaptcha maintains. Fixes, clearer code and better tests are welcome.

## Run the tests

You need Node.js 20 or later, bash, curl and jq.

```sh
node --test
```

The tests run against a stand-in API on your machine: they need no API key, make no real task and spend nothing. CI runs the same commands on every push and pull request.

## Pull requests

- One change per pull request, with a test when behaviour changes.
- Keep the code small, readable and dependency-light, in the style around it.
- Never commit an API key, a proxy password or an `.env` file. The tests use made-up keys.
- By contributing, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the MIT licence of this repository.
